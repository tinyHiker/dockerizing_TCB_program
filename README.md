I dockerized a tiny python script that 
sets up a simple python server.

The server uses 
sockets to send data from the Iris dataset (a well-known dataset in machine learning, typically used for classification problems) to a connected client. Demonstrates basic server-client communication using Python's socket library,
Uses of the scikit-learn library to load a dataset

## Docker Image

You can pull the Docker image using the following command:

docker pull t4iqbal404/my_first_image

![main_image](images/main_image.png)

To install docker on my machine, I had to install a Windows Subsystem for Linux
